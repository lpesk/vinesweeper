# Run locally

Just start an http server from the project root (for example, with `python3 -m http.server`). Then open `localhost:<port>` in a web browser, where `<port>` is the port number for your server.

# Debug

To enable some debugging helpers, uncomment `debugSetup()` in `main.js`. Then you can use the JS console to add and remove text from the window.

# Caveats

* Only tested in Chrome for now, might look unpleasant in other browers.
